1. I choose case 1, "Predict stock market price for TESLA".
2. The algorithm of chocie will be regression. One of the reasons I decided on this algorithm is because we are only looking for a single value, and have no need to categorize into groups. 
3. My findings mostly conclude of finding out that the regression will be the most suited algorithm type. Alongside this we also find out that the predicted price at 2023-09-25 00:00:00 is: $282.92
